## Highlights

- Fully automated whole package release workflow
  - determine next version number
  - generate release notes
  - publish the package
- Enforce [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) specification
- New features and fixes are immediately available to users
- Notify maintainers and users of new releases
- Publish on different distribution channels (such as [npm dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag)) based on git merges
- Integrate with your [continuous integration workflow](docs/recipes/release-workflow/README.md#ci-configurations)
- Avoid potential errors associated with manual releases
- Support any [package managers and languages](docs/recipes/release-workflow/README.md#package-managers-and-languages) via [plugins](docs/usage/plugins.md)
- Simple and reusable configuration via [shareable configurations](docs/usage/shareable-configurations.md)
- Support for [npm package provenance](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm#npm-provenance) that promotes increased supply-chain security via signed attestations on GitHub Actions

## How does it work?

### Commit message format

* Based on commit messages  
  * determine the consumer impact of changes in the codebase
    * == determines the next [semantic version](https://semver.org) number
  * generates a changelog
  * publishes the release
* Commit messages conventions
  * by default, uses [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format)
  * can be adjusted by plugins
    * [@semantic-release/commit-analyzer](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer#options)
    * [@semantic-release/release-notes-generator](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator#options)
* Extra tools to enforce valid commit messages
  * [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
  * [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
#### Examples
* Let's use default configuration & certain commit message -> release types get:

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                                                   | Release type                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when too much pressure applied`                                                                                                                             | ~~Patch~~ Fix Release                                                                                           |
| `feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option`                                                                                                                                                       | ~~Minor~~ Feature Release                                                                                       |
| `perf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option`<br><br>`BREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed.`<br>`The default graphite width of 10mm is always used for performance reasons.` | ~~Major~~ Breaking Release <br /> (Note that the `BREAKING CHANGE: ` token must be in the footer of the commit) |

### Automation with CI
* TODO:
**semantic-release** is meant to be executed on the CI environment after every successful build on the release branch.
This way no human is directly involved in the release process and the releases are guaranteed to be [unromantic and unsentimental](https://github.com/dominictarr/sentimental-versioning#readme).

### Triggering a release
* TODO:
For each new commit added to one of the release branches (for example: `master`, `main`, `next`, `beta`), with `git push` or by merging a pull request or merging from another branch, a CI build is triggered and runs the `semantic-release` command to make a release if there are codebase changes since the last release that affect the package functionalities.

**semantic-release** offers various ways to control the timing, the content and the audience of published releases.
See example workflows in the following recipes:

- [Using distribution channels](docs/recipes/release-workflow/distribution-channels.md#publishing-on-distribution-channels)
- [Maintenance releases](docs/recipes/release-workflow/maintenance-releases.md#publishing-maintenance-releases)
- [Pre-releases](docs/recipes/release-workflow/pre-releases.md#publishing-pre-releases)

### Release steps
* Once the tests are run -> `semantic-release` will execute the following steps:

| Step              | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Verify Conditions | Verify all the conditions to proceed with the release.                                                                          |
| Get last release  | Obtain the commit corresponding to the last release by analyzing [Git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). |
| Analyze commits   | Determine the type of release based on the commits added since the last release.                                                |
| Verify release    | Verify the release conformity.                                                                                                  |
| Generate notes    | Generate release notes for the commits added since the last release.                                                            |
| Create Git tag    | Create a Git tag corresponding to the new release version.                                                                      |
| Prepare           | Prepare the release.                                                                                                            |
| Publish           | Publish the release.                                                                                                            |
| Notify            | Notify of new releases or errors.                                                                                               |

## Requirements

In order to use **semantic-release** you need:
